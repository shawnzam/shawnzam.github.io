# When the Words Won't Come: Dysgraphia, AI, and the Bridge I've Been Looking For

*A personal essay*

---

There is a particular kind of frustration that parents do not talk about enough. In our house it has not been quiet. It has been loud. It has been arguments that stretch for hours at the kitchen table. It has been raised voices over handwriting that drifts across the page, over a poster that should have been planned in pencil before the permanent marker came out, over a worksheet that could have been neater if he would just slow down.

I have asked him to erase and try again. I have pushed him to outline before writing. I have insisted that he think it through first. I have watched small mistakes turn into tears, then anger, then shame. And beneath all of it there has been the same stubborn belief on my part that if he would just try harder, be more careful, be more organized, this would not be so hard.

The worst part is that I recognize the look on his face when it falls apart. The flash of frustration. The defensiveness. The sense that he is being judged for something he cannot quite control.

Because I have worn that look too.

## Watching My Son

My son was diagnosed with dysgraphia at age eight. That was four years ago.

For those unfamiliar, dysgraphia is not about intelligence and it's not simply "bad handwriting." It's a neurological learning difference where the pathway between thinking and writing breaks down. The ideas are there. The words are there. But the act of getting them onto a page, spelling them correctly, forming the letters, organizing the sentences while holding the idea in your head, can consume so much mental energy that the original thought gets lost in the process.

Researchers describe it as a problem with transcription: the mechanical act of converting thoughts into written language. And when transcription is hard, it doesn't just slow you down. It competes with the very thinking you're trying to express. Studies on writing and learning differences show that when lower level skills like handwriting and spelling aren't automatic, they consume working memory, the brain's short term workspace, leaving less capacity for planning, organizing, and actually saying what you mean. You're essentially trying to have a conversation while simultaneously doing long division in your head.

Researchers estimate that somewhere between 7 and 15 percent of school age children experience some form of developmental writing disorder. That's not a small number. That's two or three kids in every classroom quietly fighting a battle most people around them don't see, because the struggle is invisible. These kids look fine. They participate in discussion. They understand the material. They just can't get it out.

Watching my son struggle, I kept thinking: the problem isn't what's in his head. The problem is the bridge between his head and the page.

## Then I Started Looking at Myself

Here's the thing about neurodevelopmental differences: they run in families. And sometimes a child's diagnosis is the mirror a parent never knew they needed.

I never had a formal diagnosis. But as I started reading about dysgraphia, the research papers, the clinical descriptions, the personal accounts, I kept nodding. The slow handwriting. The spelling errors that appeared even when I knew how to spell the word. The feeling of having a complete, well formed idea and then watching it become something smaller and messier by the time it hit the page. I remember looking at my peers and wondering why writing seemed to come more easily to them, why their papers looked cleaner, more confident, more finished. I felt inadequate in ways I did not have language for at the time.

I went to art school. I got a master's degree in computer science. I've spent over a decade at one of the world's leading business schools. The ideas have never been the problem.

The translation has always been the problem.

I found ways to manage. I got faster at typing. I learned to draft in fragments and stitch them together. I experimented with text to speech and speech to text tools for proofreading. I edited heavily. I built workarounds without ever naming what I was working around.

Many adults with dysgraphia do exactly this. We compensate. We develop strategies. We succeed, but we carry a quiet overhead cost that others don't. We rarely talk about it because by the time we've figured out how to manage, we've also internalized the idea that the struggle was just something about us, not something that had a name.

## What the Research Actually Says

Dysgraphia has been studied and defined in various ways over the decades, but modern research has given us a much clearer picture of what's actually happening in the brain.

Writing turns out to be an extraordinarily complex act. My wife is a writer. I have watched her draft in shorthand, capturing thoughts quickly and fluidly in ways that have always seemed both impossible and deeply impressive to me. Reading about the cognitive architecture of writing helped me see that what looked effortless from the outside rests on layers of automatic processes that do not feel automatic to everyone. At the neurological level, researchers have identified distinct systems responsible for different parts of the process. Orthographic long term memory is where your brain stores the spelling of words, the visual patterns and letter sequences you've learned over time. Orthographic working memory is the short term buffer that holds a word's spelling in mind while you're actively writing it out, letter by letter. Then there are the motor systems responsible for physically executing the handwriting or typing.

Large scale brain mapping studies, where researchers examine which areas of the brain are damaged in people who develop writing difficulties after strokes or injuries, have shown that these systems are distinct and can break down independently. One person might have intact word knowledge but struggle to hold letter sequences in mind while writing. Another might have difficulties with the motor planning of letter forms. The result in both cases can look similar from the outside: messy, slow, effortful writing. But the underlying mechanisms are different.

For children developing these skills, the picture is similarly varied. Research has found that dysgraphic children often show weaker phonological processing, the ability to connect sounds to letters and words, and that within the dysgraphic population, distinct profiles emerge. Dysgraphia also frequently co occurs with dyslexia and ADHD, which is why the experience of many neurodivergent individuals involves a constellation of challenges rather than a single, clean diagnosis.

None of this is about intelligence. The higher order thinking, the ideas, the analysis, the creativity, can be completely intact. The problem is lower in the stack.

## The Old Solutions and Their Limits

For decades, the primary accommodations for dysgraphia centered on reducing the transcription burden through low tech and mid tech tools. Extended time. Typed assignments instead of handwritten. Scribes. Speech to text dictation software.

The evidence for some of these is real. A controlled UK study of children with significant communication and writing needs found that training them to use speech to text software for structured writing tasks over several weeks produced measurable improvements in both the quantity and quality of their writing, and perhaps more importantly, statistically significant gains in self esteem. Students reported feeling more independent than when relying on a human scribe. That's not nothing. Independence matters, especially for a child who has spent years watching peers write easily while they struggle.

Word prediction software, tools that suggest the next word as you type, has also been studied, with some evidence suggesting improvements in words produced and spelling accuracy. But researchers have been honest that the evidence base here is limited and aging. Most studies predating modern AI were conducted with tools that now look primitive compared to what's in our pockets.

The honest summary of the pre AI era: the tools helped at the edges, but they didn't solve the core problem. They made transcription slightly less painful. They didn't remove the bottleneck. And they often introduced new ones: the awkwardness of dictating aloud in a classroom, the unpredictability of older speech recognition, the cognitive overhead of using a separate accessibility tool while everyone else just typed.

## Then AI Arrived and Something Shifted

I've been working in technology for a long time. I've built tools. I've evaluated tools. I've sat through a lot of hype cycles. I tend to be cautious about claims that any new technology is going to change everything.

But when I started using modern AI writing tools, not as a researcher, not as an IT director, but as someone who has struggled to get words out of his head for his entire life, something felt different.

Not because the AI was thinking for me. It wasn't. Every idea in anything I've produced with AI assistance started with me. The analysis, the argument, the direction: mine. What changed was the friction.

I could speak a half formed thought and watch it become a coherent sentence. I could dump a paragraph of messy, tangled prose and ask for three cleaner alternatives, then pick the one that sounded like me. I could outline an idea in fragments and have the structure handed back to me, ready to fill in. The bottleneck, the transcription layer that had always competed with my thinking, started to shrink.

For the first time in my professional life, my output started to feel like it actually matched what was in my head.

That's not a productivity improvement. That's a different experience of being able to communicate.

A 2025 survey study of students with disabilities in higher education found that many are already using generative AI tools to overcome barriers in academic writing. The same study found real concerns: AI inaccuracies, academic integrity ambiguity, and cost barriers that risk creating a new kind of digital divide where the tool that helps most is locked behind a subscription. These are legitimate issues. But the underlying finding, that neurodivergent people are reaching for these tools because they work, because they reduce friction that has always cost them more than it cost everyone else, rings completely true to my experience.

---

As I began to see AI as a communication tool rather than simply a productivity tool, I started to wonder how many other people are quietly carrying similar friction. Think about your own circles. Have you seen students, colleagues, friends, or family members who are bright in conversation but struggle when the task becomes writing? Have you noticed people who seem to rely heavily on new tools and wondered why? For some, these systems may not be shortcuts. They may be bridges.

The research on AI as a writing intervention for neurodivergent populations is still early. The concerns about accuracy, privacy, cost, and academic integrity are real and unresolved. But the direction is clear.

## What I Want for My Son

My son is four years past his diagnosis now. He is bright, funny, creative, and opinionated. He has no shortage of things to say.

What I want for him is what I want for anyone whose brain works in a way that the standard tools don't accommodate: I want the channel to match the capability. I want him to be judged on what he knows, what he thinks, what he can do, not on whether the handwriting is neat or the spelling is perfect.

I want the tools to get out of the way between his brain and the world.

I spent most of my career finding workarounds. He shouldn't have to.
